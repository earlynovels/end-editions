  <h1>About</h1>

<p>END Epistolary Editions presents a selection of unique or rare eighteenth-century epistolary novels held by Penn Libraries' Kislak Center for Special Collections. The texts have been prepared by Alice McGrath and other members of the <a href="http://earlynovels.org">Early Novels Database</a> team from digital surrogates created by the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text and Image. While these editions are designed for reading and annotation, you can download our <a href="https://github.com/earlynovels/digital-collection">corpus of 75 novels here</a>. These editions and this site are built using <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/ed/">Ed</a>, a jekyll theme for static digital editions in line with principles of <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing</a>.</p>
